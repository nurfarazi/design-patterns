### 🏗️ **Abstract Factory Pattern (Simple Definition)**

It’s like a **factory that makes other factories** — each factory makes a whole **set of matching things**.

---

### 🍽️ Easy Example:

Imagine you're setting a dinner table.

You can choose:

* A **fancy set**: fancy plate 🍽️, fancy glass 🥂, fancy napkin 🧺
* A **casual set**: paper plate 🥡, plastic cup 🥤, paper napkin 🧻

You don’t pick items one by one.
Instead, you say “Give me a **fancy set**,” and it gives you **all matching things**!

That’s what **Abstract Factory** does — it gives you a group of related things that work well together.

### 🧠 Super Simple Definition:

> Abstract Factory is a factory that makes families of related things, without choosing the exact items yourself.
