### 🏭 **Factory Method Pattern (Simple Definition)**

It’s a way to make things (objects) without saying exactly what kind of thing to make. Instead, you let someone else decide which one to build.

---

### 🧁 Example (Easy to Understand):

Imagine you go to a dessert shop and ask for a "treat."
The shop says:

* If it's your birthday, you get cake 🎂
* If it's hot outside, you get ice cream 🍦
* If it's cold, you get cookies 🍪

You don’t say what you want — the shop decides what kind of treat to make for you. That’s a **Factory Method**.

### 🧠 Super Simple Definition:

> Factory Method is like a smart helper that decides what object to make, so you don’t have to decide yourself.
